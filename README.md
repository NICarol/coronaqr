# Go Corona QR Code Decoder

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/stapelberg/coronaqr.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stapelberg/coronaqr)

This repository contains a decoder and verifier for EU Digital COVID Certificate
(EUDCC) QR code data, written in Go.

If you got vaccinated and want to know what is stored in the QR code, this
package (and example program) can answer that question!

Example usage:
```
go install github.com/stapelberg/coronaqr/cmd/coronadecode@latest

apt install curl zbar-tools
curl -sL https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-testdata/raw/main/CH/png/1.png | \
	zbarimg --quiet --raw - | \
	coronadecode
```

(With older Go versions before 1.16, use `go get -u github.com/stapelberg/coronaqr/cmd/coronadecode` instead.)

## Verification

For cryptographic signature üîê verification to work, you need to obtain a trust
list from somewhere, i.e. a list of certificates that you deem suitable for
verification.

The [`trustlistmirror`
package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stapelberg/coronaqr/trustlist/trustlistmirror)
implements loading the trust lists of the German, Austrian or French
governments, which each include all the certificates that are accepted EU-wide.

This is how you would select which trust list to use:

```
curl -sL https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-testdata/raw/main/CH/png/1.png | \
        zbarimg --quiet --raw - | \
        coronadecode -verify -trustlist=trustlistmirror/at
```

## Compliance

This implementation passes the positive interoperability tests ‚úÖ of multiple
countries provided in the
https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-testdata/ repository.

Implementing the negative tests are tracked in https://github.com/stapelberg/coronaqr/issues/2
